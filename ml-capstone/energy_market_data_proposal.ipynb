    "The Bundesnetzagentur's electricity market information platform \"SMARD\" is an abbreviation of the German term “Strommarktdaten”, which translates to electricity market data. Data that is published on SMARD’s website gives an up-to-date and in-depth overview of what is happening on the German electricity market. \n",
    "\n",
    "How high is electricity supply and demand? How big is the share of electricity generated from renewable sources? How does electricity consumption change over the course of the day? How much electricity is imported into Germany and exported to its neighbours? SMARD's market data provides answers to these and many other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following electricity market data categories can be accessed/downloaded:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Electricity generation\n",
    "     * Actual generation\n",
    "     * Forecasted generation\n",
    "     * Installed capacity     \n",
    "<br>     \n",
    " - Electricity consumption\n",
    "     * Realised consumption\n",
    "     * Forecasted consumption\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - The market\n",
    "     * Wholesale market price\n",
    "     * Commercial exchanges\n",
    "     * Physical flows     \n",
    "<br>  \n",

    "     * Tertiary balancing reserve\n",
    "     * Exported balancing energy\n",
    "     * Imported balancing energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data is available from 2015 onwards. The statistical data available is visuallized and limited to a specific subcategory (for example: Electricity generation --> Actual generation). The visualization does not convey how the data is correlated to one another and also the correlation of data between different catagories like \"Actual generation\" and \"Wholesale market price\" would be a very interesting to determine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What makes SMARD Data so interesting?\n",
    " - Data is already consolidated from different transmission system operators in a standard format\n",
    " - High frequency of data (in 15 minute / hourly intervals) provides a good basis for data analysis\n",
    " - Data available from 2015 ist constantly updated\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Personal motivations\n",
    "In my current role, I'm responsible to create new digital services for electromobility. I was curious to know more about the sources of energy produced in Germany and the current trend for regenerative energy. Since in the end, the price is a deciding factor for the end customer I chose to determine the current trend regarding energy prices based on different sources."

    "*Electricity is grid-based and very difficult to store. Although batteries can be found in every household, most technologies for the storage of electricity on a large scale are still limited. They are either not fully developed or not profitable on the market. This means that electricity must be produced at the same moment that it is consumed*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The electricity market is made up of submarkets with different Prices.\n",
    "There are therefore different trading products on the exchange with different periods of time between purchase and actual supply. Electricity can be traded several years in advance on the futures market and buyers use these long-term contracts to hedge against the risk of rising prices. For this planning certainty, they pay a premium, which sellers then register as additional revenue. Long-term contracts secure income for the producers, which they can use to finance new generating capacity, for example.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*As the day of supply draws closer, the actual volumes of consumption and generation can be predicted more accurately, so the short-term spot market consists of two markets with different lead times: the day-ahead and intraday markets. Market players on the day-ahead market trade in electricity for the following day. Bids and offers specifying the amount and supply time must be submitted by midday. The exchange then determines the wholesale price for each hour of the next day and accepts the winning bids and offers. The wholesale price determined in this way is an important reference value for the electricity market, rather like the closing price of a stock on the stock market. For this reason, the day-ahead wholesale prices of the most important electricity exchange EPEX are shown on the SMARD website. Electricity can be traded until 30 minutes before supply in the continuous intraday trading.* [2]\n",
